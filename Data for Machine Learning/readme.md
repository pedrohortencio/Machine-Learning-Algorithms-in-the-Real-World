### Problems with GitHub loading the Jupyter Notebook
The preparing_data.ipynb can have problems to load because of its size (31MB).

If that's the case, you can easily open it in the Colab Notebook with [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1D6jMvdm6LO6FHbWT1Oyx5Gv1xMif6zcX). To run the cells, don't forget to upload the data files to the virtual machine in Colab (just click on the folder, in the right corner, drag the files and update the path in the code).
