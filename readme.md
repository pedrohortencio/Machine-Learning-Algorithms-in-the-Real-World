# Machine Learning: Algorithms in the Real World
Repository that contains files and assignments from Coursera's [Machine Learning: Algorithms in the Real World](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-algorithms-real-world#courses) specialization, offered by [Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii)](https://www.amii.ca/).

# Courses

#### 1 - [Introduction to Applied Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-applied)
  It doesn't have any file because it's a more theoretical course, focusing on concepts and methodologis such as the [Machine Learning Process Lifecycle (MLPL)](https://www.amii.ca/latest-from-amii/ml-process-lifecycle-part-1/).


#### 2 - [Machine Learning Algorithms: Supervised Learning Tip to Tail](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-classification-algorithms)


#### 3 - [Data for Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-machine-learning)


#### 4 - [Optimizing Machine Learning Performance](https://www.coursera.org/learn/optimize-machine-learning-model-performance)
