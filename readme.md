# Machine Learning: Algorithms in the Real World
Repository that contains files and assignments from Coursera's [Machine Learning: Algorithms in the Real World](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-algorithms-real-world#courses) specialization, offered by [Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii)](https://www.amii.ca/).

I finished the course when it just came out, so some notebooks may not be exactly as the current ones in Coursera.

# Courses

#### 1 - [Introduction to Applied Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-applied)
  It doesn't have any file because it's a more theoretical course, focusing on concepts and methodologis such as the [Machine Learning Process Lifecycle (MLPL)](https://www.amii.ca/latest-from-amii/ml-process-lifecycle-part-1/).


#### 2 - [Machine Learning Algorithms: Supervised Learning Tip to Tail](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-classification-algorithms)
*The scikit-learn library is used for all models. All data is upload to the course's repository.*
  * [decision_trees.ipynb](https://github.com/pedrohortencio/Machine-Learning-Algorithms-in-the-Real-World/blob/main/Supervised%20Learning%20Tip%20to%20Tail/decision_trees.ipynb) - code for building a decision tree model from zero, explanations about the model and visualizations. It also has some code for random forest.
  * [knn.ipynb](https://github.com/pedrohortencio/Machine-Learning-Algorithms-in-the-Real-World/blob/main/Supervised%20Learning%20Tip%20to%20Tail/knn.ipynb) - code, explanation and visualization for k-NN.
  * [logistic_regression.ipynb](https://github.com/pedrohortencio/Machine-Learning-Algorithms-in-the-Real-World/blob/main/Supervised%20Learning%20Tip%20to%20Tail/logistic_regression.ipynb) - code, explanation and visualization for logistic regression. It also contains code for Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
  * [parameter_tuning.ipynb](https://github.com/pedrohortencio/Machine-Learning-Algorithms-in-the-Real-World/blob/main/Supervised%20Learning%20Tip%20to%20Tail/parameter_tuning.ipynb) - Code for Grid Search and Randomized Search.
  * [splitting_the_data.ipynb](https://github.com/pedrohortencio/Machine-Learning-Algorithms-in-the-Real-World/blob/main/Supervised%20Learning%20Tip%20to%20Tail/splitting_the_data.ipynb) - code and visualization about how to split the data.
  * [svms_and_kernels.ipynb](https://github.com/pedrohortencio/Machine-Learning-Algorithms-in-the-Real-World/blob/main/Supervised%20Learning%20Tip%20to%20Tail/svms_and_kernels.ipynb) - Code, explanation and visualizations for SVMs models.

#### 3 - [Data for Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-machine-learning)
  * [preparing_data.ipynb]() - Extensive code for data cleaning and preprocessing using Pandas. Includes various methodologies to deal with diferent types of Missing Values (at random, completely at random and not random) and comprehensible explanations.

#### 4 - [Optimizing Machine Learning Performance](https://www.coursera.org/learn/optimize-machine-learning-model-performance)
  Just like course 1, it doesn't have any file because it's more of a theoretical course.
  
#### Personal Opinion
  If I have to put my opinion in simple terms, I would say that I was very surprised. It has light courses with a lot of theory that you don't easily find in other specializations and books. In some parts it sounds like someone very experienced is giving you life advises (and that's basicaly the truth, Amii build this courses based on their own experience). There are a lot of really useful takeaways, such as the Machine Learning Process Lifecycle and the excelent and extensive example of how to prepare and deal with messy data. As today, months after I finished the courses, I'm still using MLPL and constantly opening and consulting the codes for examples, I don't have to think to much: I highly recommend the specialization.
