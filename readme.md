# Machine Learning: Algorithms in the Real World
Repository that contains files and assignments from Coursera's [Machine Learning: Algorithms in the Real World](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-algorithms-real-world#courses) specialization, offered by [Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii)](https://www.amii.ca/).

I finished the course when it just came out, so some notebooks may not be exactly as the current ones in Coursera.

# Courses

#### 1 - [Introduction to Applied Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-applied)
  It doesn't have any file because it's a more theoretical course, focusing on concepts and methodologis such as the [Machine Learning Process Lifecycle (MLPL)](https://www.amii.ca/latest-from-amii/ml-process-lifecycle-part-1/).


#### 2 - [Machine Learning Algorithms: Supervised Learning Tip to Tail](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-classification-algorithms)
*The scikit-learn library is used for all models. All data is upload to the course's repository.*
  * [decision_trees.ipynb](https://github.com/pedrohortencio/Machine-Learning-Algorithms-in-the-Real-World/blob/main/Supervised%20Learning%20Tip%20to%20Tail/decision_trees.ipynb) - code for building a decision tree model from zero, explanations about the model and visualizations. It also has some code for random forest.
  * [knn.ipynb](https://github.com/pedrohortencio/Machine-Learning-Algorithms-in-the-Real-World/blob/main/Supervised%20Learning%20Tip%20to%20Tail/knn.ipynb) - code, explanation and visualization for k-NN.
  * [logistic_regression.ipynb](https://github.com/pedrohortencio/Machine-Learning-Algorithms-in-the-Real-World/blob/main/Supervised%20Learning%20Tip%20to%20Tail/logistic_regression.ipynb) - code, explanation and visualization for logistic regression. It also contains code for Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
  * [parameter_tuning.ipynb](https://github.com/pedrohortencio/Machine-Learning-Algorithms-in-the-Real-World/blob/main/Supervised%20Learning%20Tip%20to%20Tail/parameter_tuning.ipynb) - Code for Grid Search and Randomized Search.
  * [splitting_the_data.ipynb](https://github.com/pedrohortencio/Machine-Learning-Algorithms-in-the-Real-World/blob/main/Supervised%20Learning%20Tip%20to%20Tail/splitting_the_data.ipynb) - code and visualization about how to split the data.
  * [svms_and_kernels.ipynb](https://github.com/pedrohortencio/Machine-Learning-Algorithms-in-the-Real-World/blob/main/Supervised%20Learning%20Tip%20to%20Tail/svms_and_kernels.ipynb) - Code, explanation and visualizations for SVMs models.

#### 3 - [Data for Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-machine-learning)


#### 4 - [Optimizing Machine Learning Performance](https://www.coursera.org/learn/optimize-machine-learning-model-performance)
